            <p>The Aircraft Hall contains the exhibition Air power in the Pacific, 1941–53. You can learn about both the practical side of air power – how aircraft work and are put together – and the stories of how it affected everyday life during the Second World War and the Korean War.</p>

          <h2>First World War</h2>
            <p>Australia’s involvement in the First World War began when Britain and Germany went to war on 4 August 1914, and both Prime Minister Joseph Cook and Opposition Leader Andrew Fisher, who were in the midst of an election campaign, pledged full support for Britain.

          <p>On 3 September 1939 Prime Minister Robert Gordon Menzies announced the beginning of Australia's involvement in the Second World War on every national and commercial radio station in Australia. Almost a million Australians, both men and women, served in the Second World War. They fought in campaigns against Germany and Italy in Europe, the Mediterranean and North Africa, as well as against Japan in south-east Asia and other parts of the Pacific. The Australian mainland came under direct attack for the first time, as Japanese aircraft bombed towns in north-west Australia and Japanese midget submarines attacked Sydney harbour.</p>

        <h2>Hall Valour</h2>
          <p>The Victoria Cross, the highest award for bravery in the face of the enemy, was instituted in 1856 by Queen Victoria and made retrospective to 1854 to cover the period of the Crimean War. It was awarded to Australians for valour in several major conflicts since the Boer War until replaced by the Victoria Cross for Australia in 1991. The change was minimal; the bronze cross and maroon ribbon was retained and the new award carried all the prestige and tradition of the Imperial Victoria Cross.</p>
